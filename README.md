## README: Gym Freak Application

This project is a Spring Boot application. Spring Boot provides a convenient way to create production-ready Java applications with minimal configuration.

### About the Project

- Gym_Freaks is a project for helping people who cares about sport and healthy life style and others like calculation and nutrition

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later ([https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/))
- Maven or Gradle (build tool - if not already installed, refer to their official documentation)
- MySQL
- Docker

### Running the application

There are two main ways to run a Spring Boot application:

1.  **Using an IDE**

- Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- Locate the main class (usually Application.java).
- Right-click on the class and select "Run" or use the appropriate shortcut to execute the main method.

1.  **From the command line**

- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the project's pom.xml file (if using Maven) or build.gradle file (if using Gradle).
- Run the following command:

  - **Maven:** mvn spring-boot:run
  - **Gradle:** ./gradlew bootRun

This will start the application and log output to the console. You can then access the application in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8080 (the default port). The specific port might vary depending on your configuration.

### Additional Notes

- This README provides a basic overview of running the application.
- You can configure various aspects of your application using properties files or environment variables. Refer to the Spring Boot documentation for more details ([https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/index.html](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/index.html)).
- Consider adding instructions on how to build the application (e.g., mvn package or gradlew build).

### Contributing

- (Optional) If you plan to allow external contributions, include instructions on how to contribute to the project (e.g., forking the repository, creating pull requests).

This is a basic template for a Spring Boot application README. You can customize it further to include additional information specific to your project.
